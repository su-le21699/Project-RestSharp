## Overview
This project is an automation test suite for the DemoQA API, developed using .NET 8 with C# as the primary programming language, and NUnit 3 for testing.

3. **DemoQA.Test**: Contains the test cases for `UserService` and `BookService`, test data, and configuration settings (`appsettings.json`).
